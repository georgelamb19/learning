# prefect

The code introduces [Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/), a workflow management system.

With Prefect we build pipelines by defining `Tasks` and organising them into `Flows`.

We loosely follow the 'First Steps' and 'Next Steps' sections of the Prefect Core [docs](https://docs.prefect.io/core/).
